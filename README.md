### Project Overview:

The primary aim of this project is to analyze stock market trends, provide key insights, make informed decisions, identify short-term trading opportunities, and understand market dynamics.

### Dataset:

The stock market dataset contains essential information on stock trading activities, including the ticker, date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume. This dataset tracks the performance of various stocks over time, providing valuable insights into price movements, trading volume, and stock volatility. The "ticker" represents the stock symbol, while the "date" indicates the specific trading day. The open, high, low, and close prices capture the stockâ€™s daily price fluctuations, while the adjusted close accounts for corporate actions like dividends and stock splits. The volume column reflects the number of shares traded, offering an understanding of market activity and liquidity. This dataset is crucial for analyzing stock performance, identifying trends, and informing investment decisions.
